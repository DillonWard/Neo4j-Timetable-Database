### Introduction
The following repository contains a Neo4j Database for a third-year undergraduate project for the module Graph Theory. The module is taught to undergraduate students at GMIT in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics. The lecturer is Ian McLoughlin.

## Project Overview
##### Specifications
The purpose of this project is to design a Neo4j database that displays data taken from the [GMIT Timetable](https://timetable.gmit.ie/) such as student groups, classrooms, lecturers, and work hours for a timetabling system such as the one used in GMIT. The database should contain nodes with data properties and the relationships between them.
